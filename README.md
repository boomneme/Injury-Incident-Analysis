# Injury-Incident-Analysis
This project was as a result of a quality action initiative to help reduce Lost Time injuries. 
The dataset was collected via existing company infrasture and includes information on location of injury, type of injury, time of injury, Injury source. 
Dashboards and visuals were created to gain insights into the occurrences of injuries to aid decision making towards isolating causes and implementing solutions.
